Hello there. I'm very bored, with no outlet to express my thoughts besides talking to my friends (or talking to myself in the shower), so this will just be a rudimentary blog so I can have a place to link people things. I'm not really expecting anyone to read this, but if you do: I will (likely) post about a wide variety of subjects, some of which will include heavy political themes. If you're not into that, then don't read any posts tagged with 'politics'.

Expect posts about programming topics I'm interested in, conlanging, music (production & reviewing stuff I've listened to), political topics I've got thoughts on, or.. okay, don't expect any kind of cohesive themes to the things I post other than "I thought it was interesting."
