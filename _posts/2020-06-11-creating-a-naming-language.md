*This post is aimed at worldbuilders with little to no experience in conlanging, but who are interested in the topic*

If you're someone that likes to create worlds of your own, you've probably run into the issue of naming the different things you create. There are several solutions to this problem that come to mind: you could make up random words that sound cool (a fine solution), use words from some other language (like Latin), *or*--take some inspiration from real life and create a basic constructed language, or conlang. This method has numerous benefits: a satisfingly natural feel, more consistency in how words sound, easy generation of new words, and the potential to expand the language into more than just names if you so desire. It's also *quite a bit more difficult* than the simpler options, but I think it's something you should try if you're interested in spicing up the linguistics of your world.

To start, we'll talk about some basic linguistic concepts, and then apply them to help create our language.

## Basic Linguistics

### Phonology

**Phonology** in linguistics refers to the systems of *sounds* in a language. We'll be discussing two key concepts in our language's phonology: its **phoneme inventory**, and its **phonotactics**.

#### Phoneme Inventory

A language's **phoneme inventory** is simply the collection of different sounds, **phonemes** in a language. Languages can have a *lot* of different sounds! I recommend checking out [ipachart.com](https://www.ipachart.com/), which is a helpful reference for different sounds found in languages today--you can click on each to hear what it sounds like. 

When linguists discuss phonemes, they notate it by wrapping the symbol denoting the sound in slashes. For instance, the 'th' sound in the English word 'thing' is notated as /Î¸/, while the 't' sound in the English word 'tea' is notated as /t/.
