# hello!

writings on programming, chaos, gaming, music, conlanging, politics ...


Hello there. I spend most of my time reading, playing video games, or messing around with my hobbies. I'm sort of just perpetually interested in absolutely everything, so don't expect many cohesive themes to my articles. Some of my work may be politically charged, which will be marked at the top of posts.
